Mom got angry with me again on Thursday night, &ensp;After *persuasions*, it seems she has decided that it's better to try a screen time management app than to *Confiscate* my smartphone entirely.

I was caught playing G.I., after which I actually did some serious maths revision, as kind of a compensation.

<p class="d-flex gap-1"><span>p.s.</span> <span class="flex-fill" markdown='1'>Sally blacklisted me on WeChat after the recent *incident* but now she isn't blacklisting me anymore. (By "blacklisting" I mean I was unable to view her *moments*.)</span></p>

<br/><br/>

Gotta *follow a "Dopamine diet"*.\*

* Similar to "Dopamine fasting" but not too much. Technically does not reduce production of dopamine.
