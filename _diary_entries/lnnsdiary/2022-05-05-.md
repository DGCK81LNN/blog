Dear Diary

Today has been another typical failure for me. I got home at ~7 PM, when I could have just got down to my homework. It was not until dinner that I did. That said, I could not focus a bit. At some point I fell asleep. It was at midnight that I opened my eyes again, only to find that I had done nearly nothing the entire evening.

There's gotta be a way out of this...
