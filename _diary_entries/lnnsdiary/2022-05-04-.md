# May 4 2022

Dear diary<br/>
*I found this diary under a pile of books.*

*Mom & Dad have been strictly restricting my smartphone usage, so I can't write in "Diary.txt"; I accidentally left my notebook in the computer room at school, so no "Loose". That's why I'm writing here.*

*Being away from games & coding is driving me crazy. Perhaps things will get better if I can get rid of "procrastination" (that's a new word I learned from school lessons). Just gotta do things more efficiently, and then there'll be time to play.*

*That is much easier said than done, if even possible.*

*Life is hard.*
